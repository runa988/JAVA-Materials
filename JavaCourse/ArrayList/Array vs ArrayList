What is an Array?
An array is a collection of multiple values of the same data type stored in continuous memory 
locations under a single variable name.

Example:
int a[] = {10, 20, 30};

What can an Array do?

✔ Store multiple values
✔ Access elements using index
✔ Fast data access
✔ Simple and efficient

🔴 Limitations of Array
Even though arrays are useful, they have some limitations:

1️ Fixed Size
Array size must be decided at the time of creation
Size cannot be changed at runtime
int a[] = new int[5];   // size fixed

2️ Memory Wastage
If the array size is large but usage is small → memory wasted
If array size is small → cannot add more elements

3️ No Built-in Methods
Arrays do not provide methods like add, remove, search
Manual coding is required for operations

4️ Cannot Shrink or Grow
Once created, array size cannot increase or decrease

What is an ArrayList?
An ArrayList is a resizable array that can grow or shrink at runtime.

Array vs ArrayList:
An array is a fixed-size data structure, whereas an ArrayList is a dynamic data structure that can grow or shrink at runtime.

Example:
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

Key Features of ArrayList

✔ Dynamic resizing
✔ Stores objects (uses wrapper classes)
✔ Easy element manipulation
✔ Part of Collections Framework
