What is an Operator?
An operator is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands (values or variables).

Example: 
int c = a + b;
+ → operator
a, b → operands
= → assignment operator

Types of Operators 
Java has 8 main types of operators:

1️ Arithmetic Operators
2️ Assignment Operators
3️ Relational (Comparison) Operators
4️ Logical Operators
5️ Unary Operators
6️ Increment & Decrement Operators
7️ Conditional (Ternary) Operator
8️ Bitwise Operators 

1️ Arithmetic Operators
👉 Used to perform mathematical operations
Operator		Meaning						Example
	+				Addition						a + b
	-				Subtraction					a - b
	*				Multiplication				a * b
	/				Division						a / b
	%				Modulus (remainder)	a % b

2️ Assignment Operators
👉 Used to assign values to variables
Operator		Meaning						Example
	=				Assign							a = 10
	+=			Add & assign				a += 5
	-=				Subtract & assign		a -= 3
	*=			Multiply & assign		a *= 2
	/=				Divide & assign			a /= 2
	%=			Mod & assign				a %= 2

3️ Relational (Comparison) Operators
👉 Used to compare two values
👉 Result is boolean (true or false)
Operator		Meaning
	==			Equal to
	!=				Not equal
	>				Greater than
	<				Less than
	>=			Greater than or equal
	<=			Less than or equal

4️  Logical Operators
👉 Used with boolean conditions
Operator			Meaning
	&&	 			Logical AND
	!					Logical NOT
	|| 					Logical OR

5️ Unary Operators
👉 Operate on single operand
Operator		Meaning			Example
	+				Unary plus			+a
	-				Unary minus		-a
	!				Logical NOT		!true

6️ Increment & Decrement Operators
👉 Increase or decrease value by 1
Operator			Meaning
	++				Increment
	--					Decrement
Pre vs Post (VERY IMPORTANT)

7️ Conditional (Ternary) Operator
👉 Short form of if–else
Syntax
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
Ex: int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

8️  Bitwise Operators (Intro)
👉 Operate on binary values
Operator		Meaning
	&				AND
	^				XOR
	~				NOT
	<<			Left shift
	>>			Right shift
