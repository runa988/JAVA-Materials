What is Java?
----------------
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed to create portable, secure, and robust applications.


Why Java is High-Level?
------------------------------
1. Easy-to-read syntax
2. No direct memory manipulation
3. Automatic garbage collection
4. Hardware independent

 Why Java is Object-Oriented?
 ------------------------------------
1. Uses classes and objects
2. Supports all OOP principles
3. Models real-world problems

Evolution of Java
---------------------
1991 – Developed by James Gosling (Green Team)
Initially named Oak
Renamed to Java due to trademark issues
1995 – Official release
2010 – Acquired by Oracle Corporation

Java Applications
---------------------
1. Standalone Applications
2. Web Applications
3. Mobile Applications (Android)
4. Enterprise Applications
5. Scientific & Big Data Applications

Why We Need to Learn Java?
------------------------------------
1️ Platform Independence

	1. Java follows the principle:
	2. Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)
	3. Java programs are compiled into bytecode
	4. Bytecode runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
	5. JVM is available for multiple platforms
	
	📌 Result:	The same Java program runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS without modification.

2️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java is a pure object-oriented language.
	Benefits:
	1. Code reusability
	2. Better organization
	3. Easy maintenance
	4. Real-world problem modeling
	
	📌 Result:	Java is ideal for large and complex applications.

3️  Strong Security

Java was designed with security as a core feature.

	Security Mechanisms:
	1. No direct pointer access
	2. Bytecode verification
	3. JVM security manager
	4. Sandbox execution
		
		📌 Result:		Java is trusted in banking, finance, and enterprise systems.

4️ Robust and Reliable

		Java provides:
		1. Automatic garbage collection
		2. Strong exception handling
		3. Compile-time and runtime checking
		
		📌 Result:		Java applications are stable and less prone to crashes.

5️ High Performance

		1. Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
		2. Optimizes frequently executed code
		
		📌 Result:		Java performance is close to low-level languages.

6️ Rich Standard Library (API)

		Java provides:
		1. Large set of built-in classes
		2. Networking, database, GUI, and utility libraries
		
		📌 Result:		Developers can build applications faster.

7️ Multithreading Support

		1. Built-in support for multithreading
		2. Efficient CPU utilization
		
		📌 Result:		Java is suitable for high-performance and real-time systems.

8️ Strong Community & Industry Support

		1. Backed by Oracle Corporation
		2. Used by millions of developers
		3. Continuous updates and improvements
		
		📌 Result:		Java has long-term stability and support.

9️ Wide Range of Applications

		Java is used in:
		1. Enterprise systems
		2. Android applications
		3. Web servers
		4. Cloud computing
		5. Big data (Hadoop)
		
		📌 Result: 		Java remains relevant across multiple domains.

10 Job Market & Career Opportunities

		1. High demand for Java developers
		2. Used by top companies worldwide
		3. Long-term career growth
		
		📌 Result:		Java skills remain valuable in the job market.
