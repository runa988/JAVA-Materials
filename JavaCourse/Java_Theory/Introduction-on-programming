INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING
--------------------------------------------------

1️ What is a Program?
--------------------------
A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that directs a computer to perform a specific task.

Key Points
-------------
1. Written by a programmer
2. Executed by a computer
3. Solves a problem or performs a task
4. Follows a logical sequence

2️ What is Programming?
------------------------------
Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining programs to solve problems using a computer.

Steps in Programming
--------------------------
1. Problem understanding
2. Algorithm design
3. Coding
4. Testing & debugging
5. Maintenance


3️ What is a Programming Language?
--------------------------------------------
A programming language is a formal language used to write programs so that computers can understand and execute instructions.

Purpose
----------
1. Communicate with computers
2. Solve real-world problems
3. Develop software and applications

📌 Examples: C, Java, Python

4️ Types of Programming Languages (Based on Level)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Machine-Level Language
------------------------------------
1. Written in binary (0s and 1s)
2. Directly understood by hardware
3. Machine dependent
4. Very difficult to write

📌 Example: 10101001

4.2 Assembly-Level Language
-------------------------------------
1. Uses mnemonics like ADD, MOV
2. Requires an assembler
3. Machine dependent

📌 Example: ADD A, B

4.3 High-Level Language
-------------------------------
1. English-like syntax
2. Easy to learn and write
3. Machine independent
4. Requires compiler or interpreter

📌 Examples: C, Java, Python

4.4 Middle-Level Language
----------------------------------
1. Supports high-level features
2. Also allows low-level memory access

📌 Example: C

5️  Types of Programming (Paradigms)
----------------------------------------------

5.1 Procedural Programming
----------------------------------
1. Program divided into functions
2. Focus on step-by-step execution

📌 Example: C

5.2 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
--------------------------------------------------
1. Program built using objects and classes
2. Data + methods combined

📌 Core Concepts:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance
5. Polymorphism
6. Abstraction

📌 Example: Java

5.3 Scripting Programming
--------------------------------
1. Used for automation
2. Interpreted

📌 Example: Python

5.4 Functional Programming
----------------------------------
1. Uses mathematical functions
2. Avoids changing data

📌 Example: Python (supports FP)
